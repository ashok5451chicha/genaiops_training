"""
Verify what a model tells you  (human-in-the-loop in practice)
=============================================================
A fluent answer is not a correct answer. This script shows a simple, reusable pattern:

    PROPOSE  -> the model extracts figures from a contract, each with a word-for-word quote
    VERIFY   -> CODE checks (a) the quote really exists in the document,
                              (b) the number really appears in that quote, and
                              (c) derived figures match an independent recalculation
    TIER     -> any failed check raises the risk tier
    DECIDE   -> a human reviews anything that is not LOW, and every decision is logged

The model is allowed to be wrong; the system is not allowed to ACT on an unchecked answer.

Run:
    python solutions/day2_models_and_embeddings/verify_outputs.py --offline-demo   # no API key needed
    python solutions/day2_models_and_embeddings/verify_outputs.py                   # live call to the model

--offline-demo uses a prepared model reply that contains two deliberate mistakes
(a made-up quote and a wrong calculation) so you can watch the checks catch them.
